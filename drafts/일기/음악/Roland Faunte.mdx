Sometimes I picture this happy life  
Burning in the depth of time where  
Sadness is a myth to me  
Is that something you can give to me?  
<br/>
I picture this silent room  
Humming with that silent tune  
That my body sings when I get close to you  
So hear me now, it might be ending soon  
<br/>
I picture that morning kiss  
The death of pain and loneliness  
You give me strength when you hold my hand  
I'm that headless heart, that broken man  
<br/>
And as I'm walking around the void  
And I hear that easy voice that  
Tells you when there's nothing left for you  
My darling I could die right next to you  
<br/>
Singing la da da da na na na  
La da na na na na na  
La da da dum  
<br/>
And I can do  
What you ask  
Before you ask it, let me have it  
<br/>
Give me nothing, but let me know you  
And I will be there, just let me show you  
Give me heartache  
If that means a reason that I would continue  
<br/>
Please, I need them  
Because you mattered  
When nothing mattered  
If I need something let me have her  
<br/>
I can be there, I can be there  
All my secrets, come and see them  
And I can help you, as you heal me  
<br/>
